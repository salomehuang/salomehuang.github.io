            I learned the significance of actively studying design elements with apps, analyzing components such as hierarchy, content, intent, and audience to better improve my own product sense and design choices. 
            The breakdown of various apps such as Airbnb, Twitter and Spotify was particularly interesting to me. 
            It gives a lot of observations and insights into the design decisions and also highlights how even the smallest details can impact the overall user experience. 
            The quote from the article: “Know the rules, so you can creak em” resonates with me a lot. It emphasizes the importance of understanding design principles before experimenting with them. 
            I would rate this article a solid 7 because it was both engaging and informative, offering valuable insights into the world of design.
